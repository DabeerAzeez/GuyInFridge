# 🙋‍♂️ Hi there!
Pardon the horrible cursive (I'm no artist), but yes, my name is Dabeer, and I'm an avid biomedical engineering student who has some (albeit limited) time for side projects to upload to GitHub! 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- A website for consumers to view a large quantity of news articles on an interactive map
  - Using Angular, some news APIs to search for the news, a map API to display the news, and some ingenuity and teamwork to put it all together on an Angular/Firebase app

## 🦉 I have some experience with
- Python
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Typescript
- Angular
- Firebase
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduinos
